# HLAdetector
This software aims to detect the HLA gene based on RNA-seq.

## Description
The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system plays a pivotal role in immune response regulation, serving as a key component in the identification and defense against foreign substances, and its understanding holds profound implications for various aspects of human health and disease. Nevertheless, the considerable polymorphism and homology exhibited by HLA genes pose a formidable challenge in their accurate detection through RNA-seq methodologies. The intricacies arising from the high degree of genetic diversity demand sophisticated analytical approaches to discern and characterize HLA gene profiles with precision and reliability. In the course of our research, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline. This project aims to detection and comparative analysis of HLA genes, leveraging RNA-seq in conjunction with ISO-seq and a Contrastive Learning Neural Network.
